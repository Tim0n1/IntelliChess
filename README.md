Script that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the edges and squares of a chessboard. It employs Canny edge detection to identify contours, followed by Hough Line Transform or adaptive thresholding to refine the board's structure. Perspective transformation is applied to correct distortions, ensuring accurate square detection.
